    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <a href="/index.html">Home</a>
    <h2>
      Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: 1. were blocked on a
      simple problem:
    </h2>
    <p>
      What was the problem? I had issues with the manipulating-objects the part
      where I was getting an error showing up that a line in my code wasn't
      defined, and it was throwing out my whole code (at the time, I didn't know
      it was). Once I fixed that, everything turned out right. What
      problem-solving techniques did you use? I tried walking away for a few
      minutes to clear my head and unfocus from the issue, but in the end, it
      was asking for help that resolved it. How did you feel throughout the
      process? At first, I was a little frustrated, but once I had been away
      from the computer for a few minutes, I could get back into it, and after I
      had help from a facilitator. To figure out what was wrong, I felt
      sheepish. What did you learn? Ask for help when you are stuck, and even in
      the early stages of being stuck, it saves the frustration.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
    <p>
      What was the problem? I don't believe that I've ever solved anything
      elegantly. What problem-solving techniques did you use? My main
      problem-solving technique was Google, looking up YouTube videos, and
      asking for help. How did you feel throughout the process? Like I was
      trying to get somewhere in the dark with only the light on my 80's casio
      watch to light the way. What did you learn? I am asking for help from
      others sooner.
    </p>
    <h2>
      3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h2>
    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
    <p>Not really. I don't even understand what I write</p>
    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <p>
      At first, but then when everything I tried doesn't work, and most of the
      time, I need to remember what I've tried, and like a goldfish in a fish
      bowl, I always end up at the same place, just a lot more frustrated.
    </p>
    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <p>
      I tried that I name a stress ball wilson but wilson had a bad mouth and
      negative attitude so wilson is no longer around.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <p>No, not really. I should probably do/learn this more.</p>
    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <p>I always forget what to write for console logging</p>
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p>
      My first step is looking up YouTube videos, but I can get trapped watching
      other videos that have nothing to do with what I'm trying to do. Sometimes
      it's counterproductive.
    </p>
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <p>
      I have put my questions out there, I need to do this more often. Like they
      say more heads are better then one.
    </p>
    <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
    <p>
      Asking for help is the thing I'm trying to do more often and more of.
      Improving your process with reflection I'm not 100% confident reflections
      help me out because I find it hard to remember the next day.
    </p>
    <h2>
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
      made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the time, I was reluctant to ask for help because growing up, if you
      didn't know something, then you were laughed at and made fun of, even as a
      kid, so I never asked for help; I would always try to find out what it was
      I needed to learn then as I got older I stopped caring college I was there
      to pretty much eat my lunch. It's only now that I'm older that I've come
      to the understanding that you don't know what you don't know. Asking for
      help now still brings back those fears of looking stupid, but now is the
      time to put my big boy pants on so I can get ahead and excel.
