      When my son turned 17, he really wanted to throw a birthday party with his
      friends at our house. The tricky part was that they wanted to have some
      drinks. After giving it some thought, I decided to allow the party with
      parental supervision. My reasoning was that I'd rather have them here
      where I could keep an eye on things, ensuring they were safe, rather than
      having them sneak off somewhere else. We made sure to provide both
      alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, along with plenty of food. Ultimately,
      everyone had a good time, and it was the right choice for everyone's
      safety and enjoyment.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity. Identify your strengths and how they will support you
      during your learning journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My cultural background hasn't played a significant role in shaping my
      values and identity. Instead, it's been the influence of my family and
      various life situations that have molded who I am today. I distinctly
      remember a transformative moment when I became a father, marking a pivotal
      point in my identity. As a parent, I realized the responsibility of
      raising children to become decent humans, becoming a guiding force and
      setting an example for them. In terms of strengths, I've found
      adaptability to be a cornerstone of my character. Whether faced with
      family responsibilities or various life challenges, I've consistently put
      on my 'big boy pants' and embraced the role of an adult. In my learning
      journey, these strengths—adaptability, a keen sense about people, and life
      experiences—serve as valuable assets. They have not only shaped my
      identity but also provide a solid foundation for navigating new challenges
      and acquiring new knowledge.

    <h2>Your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
    <p>
      I've faced challenges in learning throughout my life, often feeling the
      pressure to conform to what seemed to come naturally to others. For a long
      time, I struggled with self-doubt, thinking that I wasn't as smart as
      everyone else. This internalized belief led me to put immense pressure on
      myself, sometimes adopting a clown-like demeanor as a coping mechanism.
      Recently, I've come to a significant realization—I'm highly likely to have
      ADHD. Understanding this aspect of myself has opened up a new chapter in
      my learning journey. It explains why traditional learning methods might
      not have been as effective for me and why I've encountered unique
      challenges. Now, as I embark on learning a new course, I'm navigating not
      only the subject matter but also how my ADHD may affect the process. This
      self-awareness allows me to explore tailored strategies and accommodations
      that cater to my learning style. While it presents its own set of
      challenges, acknowledging and addressing these limitations is a positive
      step toward a more personalized and effective learning experience.

      How might these affect your learning journey? Share an example of when you
      were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or
      tension.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Learning has consistently presented challenges for me, but I've developed
      effective strategies to overcome them. In team projects, I've often found
      myself taking a more reserved role, standing in the background rather than
      actively participating. This tendency stems from a fear of being perceived
      as unintelligent. I want to contribute meaningfully, but the worry of
      judgment sometimes holds me back. An example of this was during a
      collaborative project where my instinct was to stay in the background.
      Despite having valuable insights or ideas, I hesitated to voice them
      openly. This led to a situation where my contributions, though potentially
      significant, were kept to a minimum. It created a dynamic where tension or
      resistance may have arisen due to the perceived lack of involvement.
      Recognizing this pattern is crucial for me. Moving forward, I aim to
      actively work on overcoming this reluctance, ensuring that my unique
      perspectives are heard and valued in team settings. It's a part of my
      ongoing learning journey to not only understand the subject matter but
      also improve how I collaborate with others effectively.

    <h2>
      Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
      your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the time, my strategy for working in team projects involved taking a
      more reserved role, standing in the background to avoid potential
      judgment. While this allowed me to be seen rather than heard, it limited
      the extent of my contributions. The effectiveness of this strategy can be
      seen in the sense that I was able to participate to some degree without
      feeling exposed. However, it also hindered my ability to fully engage with
      the team and share valuable insights. Reflecting on this, I realize that
      this approach might not have been the most effective in fostering true
      collaboration and maximizing the potential of the team project. In
      hindsight, I understand that contributing more actively would not only
      benefit the project but also provide an opportunity for me to challenge my
      fear of judgment. Moving forward, I would explore strategies that
      encourage a more inclusive and open team dynamic. This could involve
      setting personal goals for active participation, gradually increasing my
      involvement in discussions, and seeking feedback from team members. By
      taking these steps, I aim to create a more positive and productive
      collaborative environment while continuing to challenge and overcome my
      own reservations about contributing openly to team projects.
