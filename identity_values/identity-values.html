    <h1>VALUES</h1>
    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      <p>
        When my son turned 17, he really wanted to throw a birthday party with
        his friends at our house. The tricky part was that they wanted to have
        some drinks. After giving it some thought, I decided to allow the party
        with parental supervision. My reasoning was that I'd rather have them
        here where I could keep an eye on things, ensuring they were safe,
        rather than having them sneak off somewhere else. We made sure to
        provide both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, along with plenty of
        food. Ultimately, everyone had a good time, and it was the right choice
        for everyone's safety and enjoyment.
