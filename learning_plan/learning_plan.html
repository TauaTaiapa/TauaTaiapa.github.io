      <h2>Long-Term Goal or Career Pathway</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! My ultimate dream is to become a skilled game developer and
        create amazing games that people will love to play. I'm super excited
        about the challenges and the creativity that game development offers,
        and I believe that taking this course will be a vital step towards
        achieving my goal.

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h2>
      <p>
        I'm someone who loves to take on challenges, and I always try to stay
        engaged in everything I do. Although I find learning to be a bit of a
        challenge due to my ADHD, I see it as an opportunity to grow and learn
        new things. The course content has been so fascinating that I'm always
        eager to learn more.

      <h2>Skills to Develop at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from technical skills, I'm also looking forward to developing my
        human skills. I'm inspired by my background (mentioning police without
        direct reference), and I'm eager to enhance my teamwork, communication,
        and resilience abilities. I believe that these skills are important not
        just in a professional setting but also in navigating the complexities
        of game development.

        everything. I know that it won't be easy, but I'm determined to work
        hard and stay focused. I also understand that it's important to seek
        help when needed, and I promise to reach out for assistance whenever I
        face any challenges.

        facilitation team whenever I need assistance. I hope to receive friendly
        support and guidance from the team, and I believe that a collaborative

      <h2>Scheduling Information</h2>
      <p>
        I have my son every other weekend, but I've already organized my
        schedule to ensure that it won't affect my commitment to the program.
        I'm excited to balance my coursework and family responsibilities so that
        I can make the most of this fantastic learning opportunity.
