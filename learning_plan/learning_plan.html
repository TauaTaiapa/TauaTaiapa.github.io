      <h2>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h2>
      <p>
        I love taking on challenges and try to stay engaged in everything I do.
        While learning can be a bit challenging due to my ADHD, I see it as an
        opportunity to grow and learn new things. The course content is
        fascinating, and I'm always eager to learn more. Identifying Mindset
        Gains: It is discovering and addressing sneaky limiting beliefs that
        might slow your learning. Cheerful Mindset Reps: You consciously choose
        a growth-oriented perspective, treating it like doing reps for your
        mind. Bye-bye Mental Weights: Breaking free from self-labelling and
        fixed traits, lifting away mental weights associated with learning
        challenges.

      <h2>Skills to Develop at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I look forward to developing human skills
        inspired by my background (mentioning police without direct reference).
        Enhancing teamwork, communication, and resilience abilities is crucial
        not only professionally but also in navigating the complexities of game
        development. Embracing Mental Workouts: Adventure in challenges,
        treating them as opportunities for mental gains, just like an
        exhilarating mental adventure. Mindset Cardio Fun: Swapping "I can't"
        for "I can't do this yet," turning challenges into brain-boosting
        puzzles or games. Flex Those Mental Muscles: Realizing that your mind
        can endure and thrive in the face of adversity gives those mental
        muscles a good flex.

      <h2>Commitment to Workload Management</h2>
      <p>
        I'm committed to managing my workload efficiently, staying focused, and
        working hard. I understand it won't be easy, but I'm determined. Seeking
        help when needed is essential, and I promise to reach out whenever I
        face challenges. Failure Reps for Mental Strength: Embracing failure as
        a crucial rep in your mental strength routine, analyzing failures for
        lessons and improvements. Mindset Flexibility Moves: Viewing failure as
        a dynamic move toward success, just like a dance step in your mental
        success dance.

      <h2>Seeking Help and Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>
        I'm confident in asking for help and promise to reach out to the
        facilitation team when needed. I expect friendly support and guidance,
        believing a collaborative and encouraging environment will make my
        learning journey enjoyable. High-Five for Mental Effort: Acknowledging
        that mental effort is the superhero of growth, give a mental high-five
        for your commitment. Goal-setting Crunch Party: Setting specific,
        achievable mental goals demanding persistent effort is akin to having a
        goal-setting party for your mind. Celebrate Mental Sweat: Recognizing
        the value of hard mental work, a celebration of perseverance leading to
        triumph.

      <h2>Scheduling Information</h2>
      <p>
        I have my son every other weekend, but I've organized my schedule to
        ensure it won't affect my commitment to the program. I am excited to
        balance coursework and family responsibilities to make the most of this
        fantastic learning opportunity. Journey Appreciation Lifts: Appreciating
        the mental journey as much as the destination is similar to enjoying
        each rep in a fitness routine. Persistence Reps: Understanding cognitive
        achievements demands time and consistent effort, an endurance workout
        for your mind. Setback Squats: I am embracing setbacks as valuable
        feedback, essential for mental growth and resilience, similar to doing
        squats for strength.
